Extreme weather events in the US 1950-2011
=========================================


The [Reproducible Research](https://www.coursera.org/course/repdata) course offered in Coursera required students to complete an assignment using data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The data set provided contains information on extreme weather events in the United States from 1950 to 2011. The analysis should address two questions:

- Across the United States, which types of events are most harmful with respect to population health?

- Across the United States, which types of events have the greatest economic consequences?


The analysis is also available in [RPubs](http://rpubs.com/jcarlosmayo/repdata_pa2).
